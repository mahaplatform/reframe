  <p>Content management and information adiministration have always been areas
  of special interest to me. Throughout my career, my best work has focused on
  creating sophisticated tools for administrative users. From searchable data
  grids to multistep data entry interfaces, from drag and drop to infinite scroll,
  the vocabulary we use to describe applications has only grown. We now have a
  rich set of user interaction conventions that we now have in our toolkit when
  solving our client's most challenging information management problems.</p>

<p>Content management and information adiministration have always been areas
of special interest to me. Throughout my career, my best work has focused on
creating sophisticated tools for administrative users. From searchable data
grids to multistep data entry interfaces, from drag and drop to infinite scroll,
the vocabulary we use to describe applications has only grown. We now have a
rich set of user interaction conventions that we now have in our toolkit when
solving our client's most challenging information management problems.</p>

<p>When I started
<a href="http://thinktopography.com" target="_bank">Think Topography</a>,
I was clear that single page, HTML5 applications were the future for our
industry, so I focused my company's efforts on finding the best technologies to
enable us to do that work. We tried our hand at so many JavaScript libraries...
JQuery, Backbone, Handlebars, Ember, and Angular - it seemed like everyone was
in hot pursuit of a sensible and scalable approach to developing these client
side applications</p>

<p>When my colleague first introduced me to React, I was skeptical. After years
of working with the "next great framework", one tends to grow disillusioned with
all of the hype. In some ways, I truly believe that every framework sucks, but
in the end, you choose your poison.</p>

<p>Although the learning curve for ES6 syntax and module loading was a bit
tricky at first, we quickly saw the benefits of taking such an ordered and
structured approach to the client side of software development. (JQuery just
teaches you to be so lazy and messy...) As we started experimenting with flux
libraries and trying to develop full applications with React, we learned how to
use context and state to build sophisticated user interactions</p>

<p>Reframe is the by-product of three years of application developmen at Think
Topography. As we started using and reusing code and components, we knew that
abstracting our tools into a third party library was essential to helping us
scale.</p>

<p>We are opening up Reframe to the Javascript community to share what we
have learned about React application development and hopefully participate on
a more meaningful level in the ongoing conversation about how to build stable,
scalable, and maintainable Javascript applications.</p>
