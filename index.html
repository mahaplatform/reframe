<h2>What is Reframe?</h2>
<p>Reframe is a collection of React components designed to help developers
  rapidly prototype and build responsive web applications. Built upon open
  source libraries like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">Redux</a>, and
  <a href="https://http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>, Reframe is built
  to coexist and integrate with the existing React ecosystem</p>

<h2>Frictionless Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<p>Reframe is designed to reduce the cost and effort required to design and
  implement application prototypes. Using a declarative syntax and
  library of commonly used interface components, you can quickly assemble
  a fully featured clickable prototypes of your application's layout and
  functionality</p>

<h2>Accelerated Prototype to Production</h2>
<p>Because Reframe enables you to statically mock your data OR connect it from
  a remote data source, converting from prototype to application can be as eas
  as replacing a json object with a URL endpoint</p>

<h2>Opinionated Approach</h2>
<p>In order to provide a high level of functionality, Reframe is implemented
  with a bold set of opinions regarding how you should structure your
  application. We use Semantic UI as the foundational CSS framework for our
  components and we use Redux to manage the application state.</p>

<h2>Declarative Configuration</h2>
<p>Most functionality in Reframe is extremely declarative. You may find yourself
  writing more JSON configuration than actual JavaScript. We've intentionally
  made configuration as simple and terse as possible - choosing
  sensible defaults where possible. We have also tried to give the developer as
  many opportunities as possible to override these defaults to configure
  the desired behavior.</p>
