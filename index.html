      <h2>What is Reframe?</h2>
      <p>Reframe is a collection of React components designed to help developers
        rapidly prototype and build responsive web applications. Built upon open
        source libraries like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">Redux</a>, and
        <a href="https://http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>, Reframe is built
        to coexist and integrate with the existing React ecosystem</p>

      <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Reframe is designed to reduce the cost and effort required to design and
        implement application prototypes. Using a declarative syntax and robust
        library of commonly used interface components, developers can quickly
        assemble a fully featured clickable prototype of your application's layout
        and functionality.</p>

      <h2>Accelerated Prototype to Production</h2>
      <p>Reframe enables you to statically mock your data as JSON or connect it to
        a remote datasource. Converting your application from a prototype to full
        featured application can be as easy as replacing a json object with a
        URL endpoint!</p>

      <h2>Opinionated Approach</h2>
      <p>In order to provide a high level of functionality, Reframe is implemented
        with a bold set of opinions regarding how you should structure your
        application. We use Semantic UI as the foundational CSS framework for our
        components and Redux to manage application state.</p>

      <h2>Declarative Configuration</h2>
      <p>Most functionality in Reframe is extremely declarative. You may find yourself
        writing more JSON configuration than actual JavaScript. Reframe intentionally
        makes configuration as simple as possible giving the developer opportunities
        wherever possible override these default functionality with more customized
        behavior.</p>
