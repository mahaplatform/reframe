<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What is Reframe?</h2>
<p>Reframe is a collection of components designed to help developers rapidly
  prototype and build responsive web applications. Built upon open source
  libraries like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">Redux</a>, and
  <a href="https://http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>, Reframe is built
  to coexist and integrate with the existing React ecosystem</p>

<h2>Frictionless Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<p>Reframe is designed to reduce the cost and effort required to design and
  implement application prototypes. Using a declarative syntax and
  library of commonly used interface components, you can quickly assemble
  a fully featured clickable prototypes of your application's layout and
  functionality</p>

<h2>Accelerated Prototype to Production</h2>
<p>Becuase Reframe enables you to statically mock your data OR connect it from
  a remote data source, converting from prototype to application can be as eas
  as replacing a json object with a URL endpoint</p>
