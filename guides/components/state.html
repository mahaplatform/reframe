<h1>State Management</h1>
<p>Redux is a powerful tool for managing state in your single page application.
  Instead of dividing your state up into many tiny stateful components, redux
  lets you combine all of your application's state into a single application
  wide state tree.</p>
<p>This is great because it enables you to inspect your application's state at
  any point in time - from any perspective. This approach, however, can start to
  break down as your application grows in size and complexity. Here are a few
  key problems:</p>

<h2>Namespace Competition</h2>
<p>Lets say you have two of the same component used in an interface - perhaps a
  textfield control on the form. Unless you are very careful with how you
  write and combine your reducer, these two components will compete for the
  same namespace in the application state tree - potentially overwriting
  each other with each successive action.</p>

<h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>As you navigate through your application and interact with various
interfaces, you will add more and more data to the state tree. Once you navigate
away from an interfaces, you probably don't need that state data any longer.
Over time, you state will grow bulky and can eventually slow down your application</p>

<h2>Reframe's Solution</h2>
<p>Refeame is a component library and we expect developers to mix and match many
  components in each interface. Because it is inevetable that this will happen,
  we built a solution into the core of how we manage components and data in the
  state tree</p>

<pre class="highlight">
{% highlight javascript %}
import { Component } from 'reframe'

class Example extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (...)
  }

}

export default Component('example', 'id')(ExampleComponent)
{% endhighlight %}
</pre>

<p>By importing the higher order `Component` function from reframe in the root
  file of your component and wrapping your component, you are able to give it a
  unique namespace in the state tree. In this case, reframe knows to place your
  component in the namespace identitied by 'id' in the component props.
  Furthermore, it knows that when actions come through the reducer, they will
  be dispatched to the 'example_component' reducer.</p>
